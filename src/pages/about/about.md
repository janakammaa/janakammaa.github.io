Hey, I'm Janaki! I currently work as a software engineer. Experience in designing and developing APIs, building scalable analytics systems and crafting data-driven solutions. My core strengths lie in Python programming and SQL, and I enjoy working at the intersection of data engineering and backend development. Whether it's architecting efficient data pipelines or optimizing query performance, Iâ€™m always eager to dig deeper and deliver clean, maintainable solutions.
